##### Classic and Contemporary Readings in the Philosophy of Education
by Steven M. Cahn

[Amazon AU](https://www.amazon.com.au/Contemporary-Philosophy-Education-published-University/dp/B00E27Z1CE/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1ILT80OAPTGVB&keywords=Classic+and+Contemporary+Readings+in+the+Philosophy+of+Education+2nd+Edition&qid=1702171746&sprefix=classic+and+contemporary+readings+in+the+philosophy+of+education+2nd+edition%2Caps%2C310&sr=8-1), 

[![Philosophy of Education Books](https://www.selectedreads.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2023/10/1-6-225x300.jpg.webp)](https://www.amazon.com/Classic-Contemporary-Readings-Philosophy-Education/dp/0199783063?crid=3NVVPTHZJJ4YN&keywords=Classic+and+Contemporary+Readings+in+the+Philosophy+of+Education+%E2%80%93+Steven+M.+Cahn&qid=1696612030&s=books&sprefix=classic+and+contemporary+readings+in+the+philosophy+of+education+steven+m.+cahn%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C233&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwhubpag0bed-20&linkId=042d53defb7e026fae30a4abed4bceac&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)

This anthology, curated by Steven M. Cahn, serves as a comprehensive exploration of the philosophy of education, giving readers a blend of foundational texts and modern insights. The book adopts a dual-layered approach: it starts off by guiding you through the quintessential works of philosophers like Plato, Locke, and Rousseau before diving into contemporary discourses that include feminism and multiculturalism.

The book also distinguishes itself by offering substantial pieces of text, thereby allowing for a more in-depth understanding. Its expanded second edition enriches the discourse further by adding even more perspectives. Indeed, this is a go-to resource for those who want to understand educational philosophy from its roots to its present-day challenges.

##### Philosophy of Education
by Nel Noddings
[Amazon AU](https://www.amazon.com.au/Philosophy-Education-Nel-Noddings/dp/0813349729/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1N2DC5O071TZN&keywords=Philosophy+of+Education+by+Nel+Noddings&qid=1702171817&sprefix=philosophy+of+education+by+nel+noddings%2Caps%2C227&sr=8-1)

[![Philosophy of Education Books](https://www.selectedreads.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2023/10/2-4-200x300.jpg.webp)](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Education-Nel-Noddings/dp/0813349729?crid=3J04PUYYGSKDO&keywords=Philosophy+of+education&qid=1696611817&s=books&sprefix=%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C150&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwhubpag0bed-20&linkId=d5658c2d16537ce38f41b87643271036&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)

Nel Noddings’ book is like a bridge between traditional philosophical foundations and today’s evolving educational landscape. She goes the extra mile by delving into both analytic and continental traditions, breaking down complex concepts like logic and critical thinking in a way that’s accessible, especially in the context of the new Common Core standards.

Given my own experience with dissecting educational policy, I particularly appreciate how Noddings does not shy away from scrutinizing contemporary trends and linking them back to foundational ideas. This book is a well-rounded survey and a must-read for not just educators but anyone interested in the state of education today.

##### Philosophy of Education
by Cahn, Steven M
3. [Amazon AU](https://www.amazon.com.au/Philosophy-Education-Cahn-Steven-Paperback/dp/B008CMTQ9E/ref=sr_1_4?crid=13Y135H0LJZ4H&keywords=Philosophy+of+Education+Steven+M.+Cahn&qid=1702171918&sprefix=philosophy+of+education+steven+m.+cahn%2Caps%2C201&sr=8-4)

In this book, Steven M. Cahn presents a chronological arrangement of philosophical discussions on education, right from Plato and Aristotle to 20th-century thinkers like Dewey. What I personally found striking is the use of interpretative essays following each major text, as they offer a nuanced understanding, almost like a guided tour through complex philosophical terrains. 

It’s a great way to get your feet wet in both the history of ideas and the foundational aims of education. The book strikes a balance between breadth and depth, making it perfect for courses in philosophy of education or anyone interested in understanding how educational aims have been viewed across history.

Richard Bailey’s book encourages active reader engagement with its topic-wise focus and questions for reflection. Not just a one-sided lecture on educational philosophy, this book invites you to become a part of the conversation. Extracts from philosophical writings are presented, followed by questions that guide you to think critically.

The design of the book makes it a suitable pick for students and trainee teachers but also for anyone interested in a hands-on approach to the subject. You’re not just absorbing information; you’re prompted to think, question, and perhaps even disagree, which, let’s face it, is what education is all about.

It’s both an introduction and an advancement of key issues, making it ideal for those new to the field as well as for those who want to deepen their understanding. If you’re looking for a well-rounded, comprehensive guide, this is your book.

##### Democracy and Education
by John Dewey
[Amazon AU](https://www.amazon.com.au/Democracy-Education-John-Dewey-Introduction/dp/1975500202/ref=sr_1_1?crid=26VUKE63132PV&keywords=Democracy+and+Education+by+John+Dewey&qid=1702172151&sprefix=democracy+and+education+by+john+dewey%2Caps%2C211&sr=8-1)

[![Philosophy of Education Books](https://www.selectedreads.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2023/10/3-4-205x300.jpg.webp)](https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Education-John-Dewey-Introduction/dp/1975500202?crid=JWTP5E9CUVXN&keywords=Democracy+and+Education+%E2%80%93+John+Dewey&qid=1696612054&s=books&sprefix=democracy+and+education+john+dewey%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C189&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwhubpag0bed-20&linkId=8ebd408b9b5692521c68f00a2371ec39&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)

John Dewey’s “Democracy and Education” is a classic that has had profound influence on educational theory and practice for over a century. In a time where education is being narrowly defined by test scores and metrics, Dewey’s thoughts are a fresh return to what education in a democracy should be.

He advocates for an environment where learning is collaborative and contextual, much like how a democratic society should function. As I’ve navigated the trenches of classrooms and educational research, I’ve seen firsthand how Dewey’s emphasis on the “environment” can make or break learning experiences.

If we think of schools as mini democracies, Dewey’s theories could not be more relevant. In a time where the focus is shifting more towards online individual learning, Dewey’s insights ring an alarm bell. Education, according to him, isn’t just about cramming information but about shaping citizens capable of thinking critically and contributing to society. I think anyone serious about reforming education could benefit from revisiting Dewey’s [Democracy and Education](https://www.selectedreads.com/john-dewey-democracy-and-education-summary/), particularly given the pressures of the digital age.

J.J. Chambliss’ “Philosophy of Education: An Encyclopedia” is a comprehensive guide that covers an array of philosophers and their impact on education from antiquity to the present. It dives deep into key educational philosophies and concepts that have shaped educational thought.

With a world that is becoming increasingly specialized, understanding the philosophical underpinnings of education can offer valuable perspective. Just like a teacher needs a diverse toolset, having a grasp of different philosophies can help policymakers, researchers, and educators make informed decisions. I love the book’s comprehensive approach; it’s like a one-stop shop for anyone who wishes to understand the many layers that contribute to educational theory and practice.

Amelie Rorty’s “Philosophers on Education” takes a historical lens to the philosophy of education, making it an intriguing read for anyone keen on understanding how past ideas have shaped current educational paradigms. The book not only elucidates the philosophy of education but also serves as a mirror to the societal values and contradictions we grapple with today.

While conducting educational research, I’ve often found myself revisiting history to better understand modern challenges. Rorty’s book works like a time machine, offering not just a history of educational philosophy but also a history of us.

##### Making Sense of Education

David Carr’s “Making Sense of Education” is a modern look at the various philosophies that impact education, teaching, and learning today. He discusses the role of a teacher and the wider moral dimensions of pedagogy, something I think is often lost in today’s metrics-driven education system.

The division of the book into three parts gives a structured approach to some of the most complex and contentious issues in education. Carr’s discussion on the “moral dimensions of pedagogy” resonates deeply with me. Over the years, I’ve often felt that teaching isn’t just a job; it’s a moral endeavor that impacts lives far beyond the classroom walls.

Wilfred Carr presents a compelling case for redefining educational theory and research as a form of critical inquiry. His book provokes you to reconsider the ethical and philosophical underpinnings of education. He’s got me rethinking how we often compartmentalize educational practice and theory, presenting a compelling argument for their interdependence.

##### What Is Education?
by Philip W. Jackson

[Amazon AU](https://www.amazon.com.au/What-Education-Philip-W-Jackson-ebook/dp/B00631ICNW/ref=sr_1_5?crid=15V6N1JIB01A8&keywords=What+Is+Education%3F&qid=1702173008&sprefix=what+is+education+%2Caps%2C201&sr=8-5)

In the style of Dewey, Jackson also embarks on an odyssey to explore the essence of education. However, he takes it a notch higher by placing education as a moral enterprise. In the age of information overload and ideological battles, the book serves as a reminder of the foundational purposes of education, which extend far beyond mere skill acquisition.
