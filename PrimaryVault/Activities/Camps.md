Brief:
If you are a maker who can take a 3D printer, a soldering iron, and a bunch of components and end up with a drone flying around or a lunar rover, Grapple23 is perfect for you! Based at the Y’s youth technology space, the 4C Centre, these week long camps are an opportunity to tackle some real world issues and challenge yourself to come up with solutions.


### Informatics Olympics Training Camp
[Home - NZOI](https://www.nzoi.org.nz/index.html#camp)

Calendar: January

Every year in January, we hold an informatics training camp for high school students (and some teachers). The primary purpose of our training camp is to train students towards representing New Zealand in the International Olympiad in Informatics.

#### International Olympiad in Informatics

The [IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics)](http://ioinformatics.org/) is the foremost high school programming contest in the world. Each year, around August, it is hosted by a different country. New Zealand first sent a team in 2006, to the 18th Olympiad.
