## Taxonomies

Learning differentiated as a hierarchy.

## Bloom's Taxonomy
Tags: #blooms-taxonomy


There are actually three versions of the taxonomy, one for each of the following domains:

-   **Cognitive domain:** which focuses on the acquisition of knowledge.
-   **Affective domain:** which focuses on the feelings, emotions, and attitudes of the individual.
-   **Psychomotor domain:** which focuses on manual or physical skills.

NB: Educators often refer to these three domains as **KSA (Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes)**.

The levels that comprise Bloom’s Taxonomy.

#### 1. Remember

The first order of thinking is to remember. This is to do with recalling relevant facts and figures from long-term memory.

Action verbs associated with this level include: define, list, arrange, and repeat.

#### 2. Understand

The second order of thinking is to understand. This is to do with comprehension and not just recall. You should be able to draw conclusions from information and summarize information.

Action verbs associated with this level include: explain, distinguish, paraphrase, and summarize.

#### 3. Apply

The third order of thinking is to apply. Here, you implement the facts and rules you have learned to solve problems in new situations.

Action verbs associated with this level include: calculate, solve, implement, and demonstrate.

#### 4. Analyze

The fourth-order of thinking is to analyze. This is concerned with breaking information into its constituent parts and interpreting how those parts relate to each other and to an overall structure.

Action verbs associated with this level include: simplify, analyze, compare, and research.

#### 5. Evaluate

The fifth order of thinking is to evaluate. This is concerned with judging or critiquing information based on criteria and standards.

Action verbs associated with this level include: prove, convince, estimate, and criticize.

#### 6. Create

The final order of thinking is to create. This concerns combining previously assimilated elements in new ways to create something new.

Action verbs associated with this level include: propose, develop, create, and invent.


### How to Use Bloom’s Taxonomy

At the core of Bloom’s Taxonomy are the action verbs associated with each of the six levels.

To use Bloom’s Taxonomy, you use the verbs to create your learning objectives.

For example, if you were giving a math workshop about prime numbers, then you might define your learning objectives as follows:

At the end of this workshop, students will be able to:

-   *Define* a prime number (“Define” is a Remembering verb).
-   *Explain* why 17 is a prime number (“Explain” is an Understanding verb).
-   *Calculate* the prime factors of any prime number under 1,000 (“Calculate” is an Applying verb).

**Teaching web development example:**
Students are beginner so start teaching from the bottom of the taxonomy.

-   **Lesson 1 (Level 1, Remember):** Explain the essential HTML elements to them. At the end of the lesson, your team will be able to _recall_ the important elements of HMTL.
-   **Lesson 2 (Level 2, Understand):** At the end of this lesson, attendees will be able to _summarize_ the purpose of HTML in some of your website’s actual pages.
-   **Lesson 3 (Level 3, Apply):** At the end of this lesson, each of your team members will be able to _implement_ their own basic web page for the first time, solving problems as they arise.
-   **Lesson 4 (Level 4, Analyze):** Upon completing this lesson, each team member will _research_ and explain what elements they should add to their web page to take it to the next level.
-   **Lesson 5 (Level 5, Evaluate):** At the end of this lesson, each team member will be able to _critique_ each other’s web pages, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.
-   **Lesson 6 (Level 6, Create):** At the end of the final lesson, each team member will be able to _create_ new web pages to meet certain objectives which they will add to your website. Here, they use what they have learned to create something entirely new.


### Advantages and Disadvantages
#### Advantages

-   It establishes learning goals to be achieved by both teacher and student.
-   By classifying learning, it allows you to think more strategically about the type of learning students should be undertaking.
-   It makes it easy to assess if your lessons and evaluations are consistent with your learning objectives.

#### Disadvantages

-   The taxonomy provides a false representation of learning. Learning is not a linear process whereby each level is separate from all others.
-   The model can blind you to the integrated cognitive processes taking place in a person’s brain as they learn.

# Factors

What factors impact our ability to learn?
- Emotion
	- Fear of not getting it, of appearing stupid
	- Shame experienced in performing poorly in the new space
	- Leaning into discomfort
- Resilience
	- The ability to manage emotions in the face of change, mistakes and learning something new
- Over-thinking
	- Vacillating on feeling like you need to know things better which holds you back from the doing
- Motivation
	- Being driven by passion vs working away consistently
	- How to explain how even when you like something that doesn't mean continued motivation can be assumed


# Validation

How to know whether anything has gone in

**Retrieval Practice**
To reinforce learning
e.g. Flash cards
See [[Apps/Quizlet]]

**Practice Test**
Options:
- an practice unpacking a question
- Could write bullet point answers to help structure thoughts
- Can braindump the answer just to see what comes out
- Can write an answer for peer assessment
- Get students to write the test questions and provide the answer





## Validation Techniques

## Leitner System

Spaced repitition utilising a combination of flashcards and boxes which account for level of confidence.  In other words, if you get a flashcard wrong it drops down a level which is reviewed most often.  Boxes can be reviewed on a fibonnaci type setup.  This is like Education Perfect.
