## What burning ideas do I need to dump right now?

- Podcasts I'm listening to and need to capture
- Videos I watched and need to harvest
- Thoughts I had
- Books I'm reading with notes



Project ideas:
##### QR Code based mobile app
Simplest thing is to create a web app optimised for mobile.  Students would each design a page (or as groups) .
But what about phone coverage?
- Could create a hybrid app where content is downloaded in the background for locations on the edge of range

##### Range detector/analyser
This is an oldie but the idea is to use a phone to build a 3d view of the network coverage within an building or site.
