# Refresh


- today is a new day
- let everything from yesterday go as your students will have done the same
- some days you will win, others you won't, but it's the incremental growth the you are searching for
- Remember that life is a laugh so start by laughing at yourself


# Incrementals

- You are the manager, start acting like one
- Start setting expectations

## Specifically

- Try using screens for notices
- 



## What burning ideas do I need to dump right now?

- Podcasts I'm listening to and need to capture
- Videos I watched and need to harvest
- Thoughts I had
- Books I'm reading with notes



## Clean your space - do it!
