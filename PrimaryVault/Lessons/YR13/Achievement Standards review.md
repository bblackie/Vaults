I need you to check you are happy with:
- Course outline
- Deadlines
- What is included in each standard


Year 13
- Design
- Digital media - their choice
- Programming
- Agile
- Computer science area
- Asbuilt


In general
- Can students do a POC within proposal and design phase?
- Can DDMO and DCP standards both be met with one project?
	- My take: DDMO is more front-end (UX) oriented while DCP is more back-end (engineering oriented)

Suggestions for your approach
- Come at it from both ends, i.e. use your imagination BUT also look at what is easily achievable
- Maslow's hierarchy of needs
