# Benefits

## Benefits of Creating Style Guides

When all brand collaborators have access to a complete website style guide, there are many benefits for internal design, content creation, and brand marketing. These include:

-   More efficient graphic design – faster time to design and create content with clear rules to follow.
-   Maintaining design consistency, especially with multiple collaborators and deliverables is much easier.
-   Code for web development can be standardized (CSS, JS, HTML) and kept DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) which reduces file sizes by avoiding redundancy.
-   Decision-making for content creation is faster and easier with many decisions already being made in the style guide.
-   Marketing strategy can be built upon the style guide and refer to these elements, especially the brand tone of voice.
-   Increases customer brand recognition as the style remains consistent across platforms.
-   The ease of having a sharable asset makes communication between clients, affiliates, and employees more smooth and concise. 
-   New employees need less training to design, develop, write, and create content when they can reference the style guide.
