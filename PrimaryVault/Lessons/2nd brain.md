Why?

From Tiago Forte:
Tiago Forte - 2nd brain

It is not about creating your own wikipedia.

Throw things into your second brain so your first brain doesn't get bogged down with them.

And then look to leverage the 2nd brain for projects as and when they come up with top down, i.e. need to do something, or bottom up, i.e. feel inspired.

Projects are better because they require less maintenance and have a shorter time span.  Basically, you will find that most of the information you capture goes stale.

It's basically a systemized way of being more self-aware.

It's like you're leaving information that your future self will discover. And what you're hoping is that it will trigger either a memory, an insight, or something like that. Exactly. You're teaching, you're preparing, you are, you're enriching your future life by the notes you're taking now.

And so one of the big questions I help people answer is like, like in some sense, the most important question with a second brain is like, why? Why am I going to do all this? Right? It takes time. It takes energy. What is the purpose? And so one of the exercises that I have them do in my course is make a list of your open questions. What are the long term recurring questions that you find yourself asking? And I the key thing here is to not have them start with do or did or is, which are like yes or no questions. Have them start with how or what? Interesting. How or what questions cannot be answered yes or no? They require an explanation, some context. And so by making this list, saving it, you know, pin it there to the top of your second brain. And then every time you're out in the world, and you notice something that could potentially answer one of your open questions, write it down. That's like your filter. What in the world will help me make progress on my open questions?
