## What are the main takeaways of the book?

There is value in the twists and turns of life.  The interesting stories.

## What  is something you didn't agree with?

I didn't pick up why the Dad committed suicide and why the black guy would want to disappear after finding him. Also, what would make him take his wallet at this point?

## What, if anything, can I apply to my own life from this book?
