# Prompts

## Illustrations

If you need good vector illustrations for your website or presentation, this prompt could save you both time and money: 

```
png white background, [subject], in the style of animated illustrations, [environment], full body, text-based --style raw
```

There are 2 important elements to the prompt: 
1. Subject Specify the subject. Also, describe what they're doing to make the picture more interesting and dynamic. For example: 
	- a woman listening to music 
	- a man giving a presentation 
	- a woman sitting at her desk with a puppy 
1. Environment Adding the location will allow Midjourney to capture the appropriate mood and ambience. Some good environments include: 
	- Study place 
	- Office atmosphere 
	- The great outdoors

### Stylising the image

You can do so by changing the "stylize" value. The default value is 100. To make flatter images with less detail, use a lower stylize value, like 0. So the new prompt looks like this: 
```
png white background, [subject], in the style of animated illustrations, [location], full body, text-based --style raw --stylize 0 
```
To make images more detailed, use a higher stylize value, like 250: 
```
png white background, [subject], in the style of animated illustrations, [location], full body, text-based --style raw --stylize 250 
```
Increasing the stylize value makes the vector appear more detailed and artistic. The maximum value is 1000.

a captivating product photography journey that presents a futuristic tactical hammock design inspired by iconic streetwear culture. The composition captures strength, efficiency, portability, and comfort in the heart of a trippy jungle. Utilize a vibrant and dynamic color palette that resonates with streetwear trends â€“ fluorescent pink representing urban energy, sleek blacks signifying modernity, and bold yellows evoking a sense of adventure. The model is asian or black people. The lighting enhances the contrast between the hammock and the jungle surroundings. Compose the photography with a focus on the hammock's unique features and design elements. The interplay of colors and patterns in the trippy jungle adds a touch of surrealism to the composition. The hammock becomes a symbol of versatile outdoor gear that blends style and functionality seamlessly. - Variations (Strong)
