## Fonts

Windows 10 -- all modern versions of Windows actually -- supports three main types of font formats: TrueType fonts, OpenType fonts, and PostScript fonts.

-   **TrueType fonts** have the extension .ttf or .ttc. Developed by Microsoft and Adobe in the late 80s as a competitor to the PostScript font format. It offered creators a higher degree of control in regards to how fonts are displayed.
-   **OpenType fonts** have the extension .otf. This is the successor of the TrueType fonts format which extends the format by adding data structures for typographic behavior to the format.
-   **PostScript fonts** have the extension .pfb or .pfm. Developed by Adobe for professional digital typesetting.

Installation:
Simply drag and drop font files to the C:\Windows\Fonts directory to install them on the system.
