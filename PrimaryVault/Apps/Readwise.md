*"Readwise is an essential. I mean, it's so crucial, crucial to all this because it just works in the background. I never have to think about it, mess with it. I don't have to go in and sink anything. It just listens or sort of detects any highlight I make. It's not just in ebooks, by the way. Ebooks on any device, but articles, like blog posts, online articles. And then it extracts just that text while keeping track of the location and which book it's from or which article it's from, saves it in my notes"
