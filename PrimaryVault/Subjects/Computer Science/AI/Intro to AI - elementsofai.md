# How should we define AI?

AI is a prevalent topic today, but its definition varies among people. In this section, we'll delve into what AI is, how it can be defined, and explore related fields or technologies.

## Key Applications of AI

### 1. Self-driving cars

- **Description**: Self-driving cars combine AI techniques like search, planning, computer vision, and decision-making. 
- **Implications**: Road safety should improve, efficiency of logistics should increase, and humans play more of a supervisory role.

### 2. Content recommendation

- **Description**: Face recognition is widely used, and AI can generate/alter visual content.
- **Implications**: Ability to create indistinguishable fake videos.

## Defining AI: Challenges and Considerations

### Reasons Why AI Definition is Nebulous

1. **No officially agreed definition**: AI is constantly being redefined as technologies advance.
2. **The legacy of science fiction**: Sci-fi often presents humanoid AIs, affecting public perception.
3. **Task complexity**: Some seemingly simple tasks are hard for AI, and vice versa.

## Attempt at a Definition

- **Autonomy**: The ability to perform tasks without constant human guidance.
- **Adaptivity**: Improving performance through learning.

## Common Misconceptions

- Words like "learning", "understanding", and "intelligence" can be misleading in the context of AI.
- Beware of **"suitcase words"**: Terms that carry multiple meanings, leading to confusion.
- AI is not a single dimension; it's multifaceted. An AI excelling in one area might not in another.

### Note on Language

- AI isn't a clear yes-no dichotomy. There are methods that involve elements of AI.
- AI isn't a countable noun. Instead of "an AI", say "an AI method".
