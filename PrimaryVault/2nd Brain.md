## Methodology

### C (COLLECT)
Your second brain needs a place to collect all the things that resonates with you, from an online article to your grocery list, through reliable tools like to-do list apps, web clipper, note-taking apps, and more.

### O (ORGANIZE)
Collecting things is easy but then you need to organize and structure them. Tiago uses a system called PARA to organize his content in 4 different categories:

**Projects**: series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.
**Areas**: spheres of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.
**Resources**: topics or themes of ongoing interest.
**Archives**: inactive items from the other three categories.

### D (DISTILL)
Capturing and saving notes usually leads to large collections of information, but the more notes you keep, the more crucial it is to keep an effective summary of them in order to be able to immediately grasp the meaning of them. Through progressive summarization, you'll be able to get the core of your notes.

### E (EXPRESS)
Once you've collected and organized all your notes and information, you should consider sharing what you've learned with the world. Otherwise, hoarding information without putting them out there in the world would be pointless.
