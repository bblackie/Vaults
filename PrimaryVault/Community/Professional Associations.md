##### Digital Natives Academy

![[Pasted image 20221125145840.png|200]]

Digital Natives Academy, a non-profit, was established in 2014 to encourage young people wanting to enter the digital tech industry the power to create, transform, shape and develop their own digital tools. 

DNA’s vision is to inspire the next generation of digital leaders. DNA does this through creative and digital technology while taking on a Te Ao Māori worldview and develops level 1-3 programmes focused on esports, 3D asset design, wellbeing, animation and livestream production. DNA provides Kaupapa Māori and Matauranga Māori programme delivery with programmes open to all who wish to join. DNA supports the delivery of accredited level 4 certificates in digital design & creative media in partnership with Media Design School.

DNA’s goal is to create career pathways for whānau who don’t have access to technology. They do this to inspire rangatahi to become makers and innovators of technology, rather than users and consumers of it.

Over the years, DNA has become more than a platform for skill acquisition and career pathways, it’s become a sanctuary from an often cold, uncaring world where the outliers of society can find whānau, friendship and most importantly a sense of belonging.
