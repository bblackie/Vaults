##### Address parser

*Postcode*

Postcodes in New Zealand consist of four digits, the first two of which specify the area, the third the type of delivery (street, PO Box, Private Bag, or Rural delivery), and the last the specific lobby, RD (rural delivery) number, or suburb.

Type of delivery:
1: Street address
4: PO Box address
4: Private Bag
7: Rural Delivery

Lobby: RD (rural delivery) number, or suburb

*Māori names*

New Zealand Post recognises Māori names for cities and towns in New Zealand; for example, the Māori Language Commission's address is:

Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori
Pouaka Poutāpeta 411
Te Whanganui a Tara 6140
In English, this translates as:

Māori Language Commission
PO Box 411
Wellington 6140

- Time are recorded in app and automatically uploaded to a central system

##### Event management

- Sporting events
	- web app with spreadsheet view to easily upload events
	- validation to pick out any issues
	- ability to slice and dice views based on event type, etc




## Pathways

##### Clickable maps
Create a clickable world map showing the university exchange locations

## General

##### Activity timer
See Electronics

##### Spelling bee
- Practice app
- Competition app

##### QR Code based mobile app
Simplest thing is to create a web app optimised for mobile.  Students would each design a page (or as groups) .
But what about phone coverage?
- Could create a hybrid app where content is downloaded in the background for locations on the edge of range

##### Range detector/analyser
This is an oldie but the idea is to use a phone to build a 3d view of the network coverage within an building or site.

##### Place based learning

A mobile app that allows learners to walk the ground while checking in at specified locations, using QR Codes for example, to view content on something of interest.

usecase - Primary school kids viewing the grounds
e.g.
“Our purpose is to.
Admire the colleges fantastic grounds, 
To learn about some of the pre human, Maori and European history of the area
To look at endemic flora (and fauna) cycles and evidence of pre european uses.
To talk about the significance of the Ruamahanga and Kopuaranga Rivers
We would park by the tennis courts behind the auditorium then walk on the edge of the eastern edge of the rugby fields, along the western edge of the cricket oval and back through Burma Road. We would be at the college a maximum of 1.5hrs.”

## Devices

##### Chess clock
e.g. https://www.chesscity.nz/chess-clocks.html
- Clock switches from one player to the other player when one of the two levers is pressed.
- Features a count down and count up timer and can be set between 1 second and 9 hours and 30 minutes for each game
- Features sound, which can be turned on or off, to mark the end of one players time

##### Activity timer
- Countdown timer for activities and exams
- Can countdown in increments, i.e. 10 mins, and then flipped to minutes and seconds later
- This could also be an app
- Examples:
	- Exam clock
	- Game clocks
		- Rugby 80 min count up with one minute shot counter
	- Egg timer
	- Steak timer (for flipping sides) - could enter in steak thickness

## IOT/Embedded

##### Water quality sensor
Solid state sensors are available but they might not be easy to replicate

##### NFC Contact Card

##### RFID Tags

Animals tagged in NZ using NAIT tags.  Could replicate this in the classroom, trialling the differences between high and low frequency.
