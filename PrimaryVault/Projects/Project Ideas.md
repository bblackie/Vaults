# Applications

##### Activity timer
See Electronics

##### Spelling bee
- Practice app
- Competition app

##### QR Code based mobile app
Simplest thing is to create a web app optimised for mobile.  Students would each design a page (or as groups) .
But what about phone coverage?
- Could create a hybrid app where content is downloaded in the background for locations on the edge of range

##### Range detector/analyser
This is an oldie but the idea is to use a phone to build a 3d view of the network coverage within an building or site.

##### Activity timer
- Countdown timer for activities and exams
- Can countdown in increments, i.e. 10 mins, and then flipped to minutes and seconds later
- This could also be an app
