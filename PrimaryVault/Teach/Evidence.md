# Ideas

## TODO

The following might also help to support the teacher judgement:
•	Teacher notes added to the student work (for example, "Post it" notes or teacher - student feedback sheets).
•	Teacher diary or running record of conversations or observations that occurred during the project.

# Milestones (checkpoints)

To ensure they have an opportunity to ask questions and gather feedback.
Plus:
- Agreed milestones need to be established for the inquiry, and 
- evidence of how these have been met is required. 
- Any variations should also be explained.

# Feedback

Includes:
- Observations

Need to capture feedback so it can be easily used by the student


# Discussion (conversation)

Could capture conversations using an app like Otto.
Need to prepare students for this and have a plan of what will be discussed
Strategies:
- Compare and contrast (see OneDrive > Activities > Inquiry)
