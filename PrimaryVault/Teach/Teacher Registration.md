[https://teachingcouncil.nz/getting-certificated/for-beginning-teachers/](https://teachingcouncil.nz/getting-certificated/for-beginning-teachers/)

# Evidence

This induction and mentoring programme is designed to assist you in gaining full certification once you have completed a minimum of two years (8 terms) as a provisionally certificated teacher. It is your responsibility to keep records for yourself of your progress over this time.

You will use an Appraisal and Certification Notebook in OneNote.

## Requirements

### What?
You need to keep records that show your progress toward meeting all the Teaching Standards. You will set up a system for recording and storing evidence of these. 
### How often?
The SCT will want to see your evidence once per term to ensure you are on track and you are expected to share the notebook with them.


As far as the types of evidence you will need are concerned, in general you should keep:

· Copies of annual and unit plans for the areas in which you teach

· Lesson plans with reflections

· Observations of your teaching and observations you have made of others’ teaching

· Notes and reflections from professional development opportunities (you are required to complete a feedback form for any external PD and give this to MPS so ensure you keep a copy)

· Data and analysis of student surveys

· Notes from meetings with the SCT (YOUR responsibility, NOT the SCT's).

· Notes from departmental meetings or staff meetings or professional learning groups at school

· Examples of inquiry learning cycles with reflections

· Examples of student work

· Examples of resources developed for your teaching programme

· Feedback from students, whānau and colleagues
